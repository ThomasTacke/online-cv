## :fontawesome-solid-address-card: About

![me](assets/me.jpeg#avatar)

Passionate **Software Engineer / Software Architect** with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in IT Security from **Ruhr-Universität Bochum**. With a strong foundation in applied informatics, I have a demonstrated history of designing and developing scalable applications using **Node.js**, **C#**, **Angular**, **Python** and microservices architecture.

My enthusiasm for **new technologies** and **security development** drives me to continuously explore and implement innovative solutions. In addition to my professional experience, I actively manage personal projects utilizing **Docker** and version control, showcasing my skills in **system administration** and self-hosting applications.

I am eager to contribute to the development of both existing and new applications as a **Fullstack Engineer/Architect**, bringing a comprehensive understanding of security practices to the software development lifecycle.

!!! abstract "Bachelor Thesis – Development and implementation of a secure WLAN concept"

    This thesis focuses on the development and deployment of a **secure WLAN** solution for multiple establishments. Various **encryption techniques**, **authentication**, and **authorization mechanisms** were analyzed to determine the most effective approach to ensuring network security. After designing the WLAN security concept, a **pilot project** was carried out at a selected establishment, where the solution was implemented and thoroughly tested through **performance evaluations**.

!!! abstract "Master Thesis – Analysis, Implementation and Optimization of an End-2-End Security Concept for the Internet of Things in an Industry 4.0 Scenario"

    This thesis addresses the challenge of securing communication in **Industry 4.0** environments, where computational devices communicate over potentially insecure channels, such as cellular radio. While existing solutions often rely on transport layer encryption, this approach does not offer **end-to-end security** across multiple untrusted hosts.

    The thesis designs and evaluates **end-to-end encryption mechanisms** for constrained IoT devices, using protocols such as **CoAP**, **MQTT**, **MQTT-SN**, and **WebSocket**. The work was demonstrated on Intel's **Quark™ SE Microcontroller**, which provided the necessary hardware environment. Through this evaluation, the most suitable encryption method was identified and implemented across the selected protocols.

    The results confirmed that **end-to-end encryption** can be effectively implemented without significantly affecting protocol performance, though scalability issues arose with increasing numbers of participants due to communication and computation overhead.
